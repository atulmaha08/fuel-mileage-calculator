# Petrol Amount to Distance / Mileage Calculator

This web-based application allows users to calculate either the **distance** that can be covered based on the amount of petrol spent, or the **mileage** of the vehicle based on the amount of fuel used.

## Features

- **Check Distance**: Given the petrol price, amount spent, and the vehicle's mileage (if known), this feature calculates how far the vehicle can travel.
- **Check Mileage**: Given the petrol price, amount spent, and the vehicle's starting and current mileage, this feature calculates the mileage of the vehicle (in km/l).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS**: For styling the page with a modern, responsive layout.
